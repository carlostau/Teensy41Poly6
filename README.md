Teensy-Poly6

This is a polyphonic synth forked from albnys/TeensyPoly6

I have tidied up the files so it now compiles properly

The analogue interface now uses 4 MUX chips to read the pots so there is no need to connect top the top or underneath of the Teensy 3.5 for the extra analogue inputs required. It runs smoother now as well.

The schematics are a mess so I will redo them too.

The synth is built using a teensy 3.5 and is programmed in Arduino IDE using the teensy audio library.
